# ASASSN Performance Test Requirements
# 
# IMPORTANT: Due to pyasassn's strict dependency on pyarrow==4.0.1 (which has issues with Python 3.12+),
# install in two steps for best compatibility:
#
# Step 1: pip install -r requirements-step1.txt
# Step 2: pip install -r requirements-step2.txt
#
# Or use the manual installation method in README.md

# If you want to try one-step installation (may have conflicts):
